/**
 * In a far away country called AlgoLandia, there are N islands numbered 1 to N. Each island is denoted by k[i]. King Algolas, king of AlgoLandia, built N - 1 bridges in the country. A bridge is built between islands k[i] and k[i+1]. Bridges are two-ways and are expensive to build.
 * <p>
 * The problem is that there are gangs who wants to destroy the bridges. In order to protect the bridges, the king wants to assign elite guards to the bridges. A bridge between islands k[i] and k[i+1] is safe when there is an elite guard in island k[i] or k[i+1]. There are already elite guards assigned in some islands.
 * <p>
 * Your task now is to determine the minimum number of additional elite guards that needs to be hired to guard all the bridges.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Note:</h3>
 * You are given a sequence k with N length. k[i] = true, means that there is an elite guard in that island; k[i] = false means no elite guard. It is guaranteed that AlgoLandia have at least 2 islands.
 * <pre>
 * Sample Input 1
 * k = [true, true, false, true, false]
 * Sample Output 1
 * 0
 * Sample Input 2
 * k = [false, false, true, false, false]
 * Sample Output 2
 * 2
 * </pre>
