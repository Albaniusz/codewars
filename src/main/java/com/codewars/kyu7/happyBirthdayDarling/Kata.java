/**
 * As you may know, once some people pass their teens, they jokingly only celebrate their 20th or 21st birthday,
 * forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!
 * <p>
 * For example, if they turn 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!
 * <p>
 * Your task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in
 * the format specified below.
 * <p>
 * Note: input will be always > 21
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * 32  -->  "32? That's just 20, in base 16!"<br/>
 * 39  -->  "39? That's just 21, in base 19!"
 * <p>
 * Hint: if you don't know (enough) about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">numeral systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix">radix</a>, just observe the pattern!
