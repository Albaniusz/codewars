/**
 * Story
 * <p>
 * You are a h4ck3r n00b: you "acquired" a bunch of password hashes, and you want to decypher them. Based on
 * the length, you already guessed that they must be SHA-1 hashes. You also know that these are weak passwords:
 * maximum 5 characters long and use only lowercase letters (a-z), no other characters.
 * <p>
 * Happy hacking!
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <p>
 * pre-generating the full hash table is not advised, due to the time-limit on the CW platform<br/>
 * there will be only a few tests for 5-letter words (hint: start from the beginning of the alphabet)<br/>
 * if your solution times out, try running it again - the CW runner is sometimes a bit slow(er)
